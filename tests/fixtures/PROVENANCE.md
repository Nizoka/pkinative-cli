# Fixture provenance

Every file under `pki/` was produced by **OpenSSL 3.5.5** running
[`scripts/fixtures/make-test-pki.sh`](../../scripts/fixtures/make-test-pki.sh)
on 2026-10-04. It has foreign provenance: neither the CLI nor pkinative wrote
any of it, so a defect cannot be baked into both a fixture and its reading.
The files are never regenerated in place; re-running the script makes new keys,
which are new fixtures with new checksums.

[`SHA256SUMS`](SHA256SUMS) pins every file; `tests/docs/fixtures.test.ts` fails
on a changed checksum, a missing file or an unlisted one.

**Every private key here is public TEST-ONLY material** (`*.key.pem`,
`*.key.der`, `*.key.enc.pem`, `*.p12`; password `test-only-password`). The
CA, OCSP-responder and TSA keys were deleted after signing.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `root.crt.{pem,der}` | Test Root CA, ECDSA P-256, self-signed, serial 0x01 |
| `inter.crt.{pem,der}` | Test Intermediate CA, ECDSA P-256, pathLen 0, serial 0x02 |
| `leaf.crt.{pem,der}` | `example.test`, ECDSA P-256, serial 0x1001; SAN `example.test`, `*.wild.example.test`, `192.0.2.1`, `leaf@example.test`; EKU serverAuth, clientAuth, emailProtection; CRL DP and OCSP AIA |
| `leaf.key.{pem,der}`, `leaf.pub.pem` | The leaf's PKCS#8 private key and SPKI public key |
| `leaf.key.enc.pem` | The leaf key as PBES2 (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, AES-256-CBC) EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo |
| `leaf.csr.{pem,der}` | PKCS#10 request for `csr.example.test` with a SAN extension request |
| `leaf.p12` | PKCS#12 with the leaf key and certificate plus the intermediate; PBES2 AES-256-CBC, PBMAC1 integrity (RFC 9579) |
| `rsa.p12` | PKCS#12 with the RSA key and certificate; PBES2, PBMAC1 |
| `legacy.p12` | The leaf key and certificate in the legacy form (RC2 / 3DES, RFC 7292 SHA-1 HMAC) pkinative refuses |
| `plain-keybag.p12` | The leaf key in an UNENCRYPTED keyBag and its certificate, PBMAC1: proves no report prints key bytes |
| `nomac.p12` | The intermediate certificate in a PKCS#12 with no MAC and no encryption |
| `certs-only.p12` | PKCS#12 holding the intermediate certificate only (no key bag); PBES2, PBMAC1 |
| `revoked.crt.pem` | `revoked.example.test`, serial 0x1002, revoked (keyCompromise, 2026-06-01) |
| `rsa.crt.{pem,der}`, `rsa.key.pem`, `rsa.key.enc.pem` | `rsa.example.test`, RSA 2048, serial 0x1003, and its key (plain and PBES2) |
| `ed25519.crt.{pem,der}`, `ed25519.key.pem` | Test Ed25519 Root, self-signed CA, serial 0x03, and its key |
| `ocsp.crt.pem` | Delegated OCSP responder (EKU OCSPSigning), serial 0x1004 |
| `tsa.crt.pem` | Time-stamping authority (critical EKU timeStamping), serial 0x1005 |
| `inter.crl.{pem,der}` | CRL of the intermediate, revoking 0x1002 |
| `ed25519.crl.der`, `ed25519-delta.crl.der` | Base CRL of the Ed25519 CA (number 1, revokes 0x77) and its delta (deltaCRLIndicator 1, number 2, adds 0x99) |
| `leaf.ocsp-req.der` | OCSP request for the leaf (SHA-256 CertID, with a nonce) |
| `leaf.ocsp.der`, `revoked.ocsp.der` | Delegated-responder answers: good for 0x1001, revoked for 0x1002 |
| `content.txt` | The content every signature and time-stamp covers |
| `attached.p7s`, `detached.p7s` | CMS SignedData by the leaf over `content.txt`, encapsulated and detached |
| `content.tsq`, `content.tsr`, `content.tst` | RFC 3161 request (SHA-256, certReq), response and bare token from the TSA |

All certificates are valid from 2026-01-01 to 2046-01-01 (UTC); the tests pin
`--at` inside that window.
